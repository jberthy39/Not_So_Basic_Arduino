## New Ping
### Description
In this assignment, I learned to ue a library called [NewPing](https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/NewPing/). In this library, there were many functions, that someone else had created and I could use, without having to type them one at a time. (This library was created by Tim Eckel.) 

## Hello Functions
### Description
In this assignment, we learn how to incorporate a function into our coding. A function, put simply, is an easy way to shorten your actual code and then reuse it whenever you want. I also learned about an [ultrasonic sensor](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/), which is just a sensor that can sense distances by sending out little chirps. For my coding, I told it the servo to rotate continuously, very fast, and as an object (my hand) moves further away, the servo slows down and then halts to a stop at 45 centimeters.

### Lesson(s) Learned
- The Ultrasonic Sensor sends tiny chirps and uses the pins Echo and Trig to estimate/calculate the distance from any given object.
